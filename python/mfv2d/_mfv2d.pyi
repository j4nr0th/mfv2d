    r"""Evaluate Lagrange polynomials.

    This function efficiently evaluates Lagrange basis polynomials, defined by

    .. math::

       \mathcal{L}^n_i (x) = \prod\limits_{j=1, j \neq i}^{n} \frac{x - x_j}{x_i - x_j},

    where the ``roots`` specifies the zeros of the Polynomials
    :math:`\{x_1, \dots, x_n\}`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    roots : array_like
       Roots of Lagrange polynomials.
    x : array_like
       Points where the polynomials should be evaluated.
    out : array, optional
       Array where the results should be written to. If not given, a new one will be
       created and returned. It should have the same shape as ``x``, but with an extra
       dimension added, the length of which is ``len(roots)``.

    Returns
    -------
    array
       Array of Lagrange polynomial values at positions specified by ``x``.

    Examples
    --------
    This example here shows the most basic use of the function to evaluate Lagrange
    polynomials. First, let us define the roots.

    .. jupyter-execute::

        >>> import numpy as np
        >>>
        >>> order = 7
        >>> roots = - np.cos(np.linspace(0, np.pi, order + 1))

    Next, we can evaluate the polynomials at positions. Here the interval between the
    roots is chosen.

    .. jupyter-execute::

        >>> from mfv2d._mfv2d import lagrange1d
        >>>
        >>> xpos = np.linspace(np.min(roots), np.max(roots), 128)
        >>> yvals = lagrange1d(roots, xpos)

    Note that if we were to give an output array to write to, it would also be the
    return value of the function (as in no copy is made).

    .. jupyter-execute::

        >>> yvals is lagrange1d(roots, xpos, yvals)
        True

    Now we can plot these polynomials.

    .. jupyter-execute::

        >>> from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
        >>>
        >>> plt.figure()
        >>> for i in range(order + 1):
        ...     plt.plot(
        ...         xpos,
        ...         yvals[..., i],
        ...         label=f"$\\mathcal{{L}}^{{{order}}}_{{{i + 1}}}$"
        ...     )
        >>> plt.gca().set(
        ...     xlabel="$x$",
        ...     ylabel="$y$",
        ...     title=f"Lagrange polynomials of order {order}"
        ... )
        >>> plt.legend()
        >>> plt.grid()
        >>> plt.show()

    Accuracy is retained even at very high polynomial order. The following
    snippet shows that even at absurdly high order of 51, the results still
    have high accuracy and don't suffer from rounding errors. It also performs
    well (in this case, the 52 polynomials are each evaluated at 1025 points).

    .. jupyter-execute::

        >>> from time import perf_counter
        >>> order = 51
        >>> roots = - np.cos(np.linspace(0, np.pi, order + 1))

    ----------
    order : int
        Order of the scheme. The number of node-weight pairs is one more.

    positions : array_like
        Positions where the polynomials should be evaluated at.

    out : array, optional
        Output array to write to. If not specified, then a new array is allocated.
        Must have the exact correct shape (see return value) and data type

    -------
    array
        Array with the same shape as ``positions`` parameter, except with an
        additional first dimension, which determines which Legendre polynomial
        it is.

    Examples
    --------
    To quickly illustrate how this function can be used to work with Legendre polynomials,
    some simple examples are shown.

    First things first, the function can be called for any order of polynomials, with
    about any shape of input array (though if you put too many dimensions you will get an
    exception). Also, you can supply an optional output parameter, such that an output
    array need not be newly allocated.

        >>> vals = compute_legendre(n, positions)
        >>> assert vals is compute_legendre(n, positions, vals)

    The output array will always have the same shape as the input array, with the only
    difference being that a new axis is added for the first dimension, which can be
    indexed to distinguish between the different Legendre polynomials.

    .. jupyter-execute::

        >>> from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
        >>>
        >>> fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1)
        >>>

        >>> ax.legend()
        >>>
        >>> fig.tight_layout()

    Lastly, these polynomials are all orthogonal under the :math:`L^2` norm. This can
    be shown numerically as well.

    :meth:`Manifold2D.from_irregular` and :meth:`Manifold2D.from_regular`. This type
    provides convinience functions for computing its dual and obtaining specific lines or
    surfaces.

    Since manifold only contains topology, the only information it contains pertaining to
    nodes is the tota lnumber of them.

    Examples
    --------
    This is an example of how a manifold may be used:

    .. jupyter-execute::

        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from mfv2d._mfv2d import Manifold2D, Surface, Line, GeoID
        >>>
        >>> triangle = Manifold2D.from_regular(
        ...     3,
        ...     [Line(1, 2), Line(2, 3), Line(1, 3)],
        ...     [Surface(1, 2, -3)],
        ... )
        >>> print(triangle)

    The previous case only had one surface. In that case, or if all surface
    have the same number of lines, the class method :meth:`Manifold2D.from_regular`
    can be used. If the surface do not have the same number of lines, that can not be
    used. Instead, the :meth:`Manifold2D.from_irregular` class method should be used.

    .. jupyter-execute::

        >>> house = Manifold2D.from_irregular(
        ...     5,
        ...     [
        ...         (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), #Square
        ...         (1, 5), (5, 2), # Roof
        ...     ],
        ...     [
        ...         (1, 2, 3, 4), # Square
        ...         (-1, 5, 6),   # Triangle
        ...     ]
        ... )
        >>> print(house)

    From these manifolds, surfaces or edges can be querried back. This is mostly useful
    when the dual is also computed, which allows to obtain information about neighbouring
    objects. For example, if we want to know what points are neighbours of point with
    index 2, we would do the following:

    .. jupyter-execute::

        >>> dual = house.compute_dual() # Get the dual manifold
        >>> # Dual surface corresponding to primal point 1
        >>> dual_surface = dual.get_surface(1)
        >>> print(dual_surface)
        >>> for line_id in dual_surface:
        ...     if not line_id:
        ...         continue
        ...     primal_line = house.get_line(line_id)
        ...     if primal_line.begin == 1:
        ...         pt = primal_line.end
        ...     else:
        ...         assert primal_line.end == 1
        ...         pt = primal_line.begin
        ...     print(f"Point 1 neighbours point {pt}")

        A dual of each k-dimensional object in an n-dimensional space is a
        (n-k)-dimensional object. This means that duals of surfaces are points,
        duals of lines are also lines, and that the duals of points are surfaces.

        A dual line connects the dual points which correspond to surfaces which
        the line was a part of. Since the change over a line is computed by
        subtracting the value at the beginning from that at the end, the dual point
        which corresponds to the primal surface where the primal line has a
        positive orientation is the end point of the dual line and conversely the end
        dual point is the one corresponding to the surface which contained the primal
        line in the negative orientation. Since lines may only be contained in a
        single primal surface, they may have an invalid ID as either their beginning or
        their end. This can be used to determine if the line is actually a boundary of
        the manifold.

        A dual surface corresponds to a point and contains dual lines which correspond
        to primal lines, which contained the primal point of which the dual surface is
        the result of. The orientation of dual lines in this dual surface is positive if
        the primal line of which they are duals originated in the primal point in question
